# 🚀 3D Model Viewer (Aeromine Project)

This project is a **web-based 3D model viewer** built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
It allows you to load, explore, and interact with 3D models directly in the browser — no additional software required.

👉 Developed as a client project for **[Aeromine](https://www.aeromine.com/)**.

## ✨ Features

* 🔄 **Interactive controls** — rotate, zoom, and pan around the model with smooth orbit controls.
* 💡 **Realistic lighting** — ambient and directional light for clear visibility.
* 📦 **GLTF/GLB model support** — optimized for modern 3D formats.
* 🎯 **Auto-scaling & centering** — models are automatically resized and centered in the scene.
* ⚡ **Fast & lightweight** — powered by Vite for modern, blazing-fast builds.
